# Furrifyer
A command line program that converts ASCII or UTF-8 encoded characters into a decrease of IQ. I don't remember why I thought creating this was a good idea. Alcohol was probably involved.

L's and R's are substituted with W's, Y's are inserted after N's if the following letter is a vowel (same with P's and W's), and random kawaii faces are inserted where sentences end (looks for `.` `!` `?`) 

### Arguments
* -t    [text]	| Supplies text input.
* -f 	[file]	| Read input from a file.
* -r 			| Raw mode, no fancy art when printing results.

### Sample Input
```
ruby furrify.rb -t "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground."
```
### Sample Output
```
